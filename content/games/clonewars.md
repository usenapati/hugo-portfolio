CLONE WARS is a AR Tower Defense Game based in the Star Wars universe. The Player scans a 3D space, then they can add towers and enemy spawners. Each round, the towers must defend the player’s ship from waves of enemies. The player can use points earned each round to buy more towers.

The game was originally a friend's school project that grew into a personal project with a team of four. The game was developed using Unity and Google's ARCore.

Clone Wars is downloadable on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TTDDevs.CloneWARsTTD&hl=en_US&gl=US).


## My Work
Contributions:
  - Added health bars over enemies to display their health to the player. 
  - Created a ragdoll animation for the enemies when they die.
  - Used Unity’s LineRenderer to display the path the enemy waves would follow. 
  - Created a Credit System that allowed the Player to earn credits for each enemy they defeated. The credit amount would depend on the difficulty of the unit. The Credits that the player earned could be spent on buying more towers.
