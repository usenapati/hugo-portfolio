Nekomancer is a 3D platformer whre you play as a cat, who was raised from the dead, and now have to search for ingredients to make a cure for your zombification. Throughout the game, you collect ingredients to make potions. The potions grant different powers, including super speed, static cling, or elasticity.

Nekomancer was developed with a team in a eight during the Red Storm and VGDC @ NCSU Game Jam, where the theme was zombie cats. The game was developed using Unity and the game assets were modeled using Blender or acquired from the Unity Marketplace. 

Nekomancer is playable on [itch.io](https://phillips-albright.itch.io/nekomancer) through the browser or can be downloaded for Windows.

## My Work
For this game, I implemented the super speed ability and collaborated with other programmers to design the ability system. Super Speed was based on the Speed Booster from Super Metroid and was tuned to work in a 3D Platformer. I designed and built the tower section of the game map using marketplace assets. I created different obstacles, specifically temporary platforms that disappear after the player stands the platfrom for a period of time. Lastly, I modeled some of the ingredients that the player acquired for the potion.
